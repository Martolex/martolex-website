              Except as described in this section, we will not sell, rent or
              disclose your personal identification to third parties without
              notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving
              you an opportunity to prevent your information from being shared.
              We occasionally use other companies, agents or contractors to
              perform services necessary to our operations. For example, we have
              partnered with other companies to personalize our Web pages,
              process payment transactions, analyse customers' interaction with
              our site and process consumer surveys. We also provide postal
              addresses to the Courier Service for delivery purposes. In the
              course of providing such services, these companies may have
              contact with your personal identification. We will not be liable
              for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal
              information by these companies. From time to time, we may partner
              with companies whose products we believe will interest our
              members. In conjunction with these partners, we occasionally send
              promotional announcements to particular members. Martolex also
              reserves the right to disclose personal information when
              disclosure is required by law, if we reasonably believe disclosure
              is necessary to establish or exercise legal rights, or in
              situations involving potential threats to physical safety. We also
              provide analyses of our members in the aggregate to prospective
              partners, advertisers and other third parties. We do this so that
              we, and our advertisers can understand you better, and so we can
              keep bringing you the best services. We may also disclose, on an
              anonymous basis, literal statements made by our members. At no
              time, however, will we disclose personal information about
              specific members. Members should check back for updates to this
              policy.
